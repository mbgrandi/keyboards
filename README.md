British International-PC keyboard layout for macOS. As we already know, macOS doesn't have an international keyboard layout for British-PC keyboards as it has for US ones. I have created this using Ukelele, see below how to install it.

You can download the Keyboard Juggler from Ukelele's website:

https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele

Set the folder where you have downloaded the layout;
Drag and drop the layout to "Installed for All Users" or "Installed for Current User";

Go to macOS settings, open Keyboard, Input sources, + and add the "British International-PC".

Enjoy!
